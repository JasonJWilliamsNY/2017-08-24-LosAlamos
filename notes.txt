Colleagues,

I am organizing a "Software Carpentry Workshop".  It will be held
behind Hot Rocks on August 24 and 25.  I'd like to have about 8
helpers, and I am writing to ask if you would be willing come help.

The Software Carpentry organization runs highly structured workshops.
This is the first one I've organized.  We are bringing in Jason
Williams as lead instructor because he has more experience.

I have a draft web page at
https://fraserphysics.github.io/2017-08-24LosAlamos/ which says in
part:

    Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in
    less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research
    computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts
    and tools, including program design, version control, data
    management, and task automation.

If the event is successful, I hope to organize others in the future
and to recruit some of you to become instructors.

Please let me know if you can help out.

Andy

    Did we discuss who will cover what? I am happy with
    Git/Shell/Python. Haven’t used MAKE but can learn.


8/3/2017     Williams, Jason <williams@cshl.edu>

    My workshop at New Mexico State is a go, so I will handle and pay
    for my travel to New Mexico. If LANL can pay for hotel (Aug 23-26)
    that would be great. Can you let me know how to get this started?

8/1/2017     Williams, Jason <williams@cshl.edu>

    Yes, I am still waiting another two days or so, but since there is a
    chance it means you won’t have to pay my way

    Maneesha,

    Have you had a chance to work on the registration website for
    LANL’s SWC workshop yet?  If so, please send me the URL and login
    info so that I can get a feel for what you are doing.

7/20/2017    Williams, Jason <williams@cshl.edu> (Replied 8/3)

    Looks good!

    You can make me a collaborator on the repo and then I will get an
    invitation from github. On the github repo page click on setting
    and then you will see an option called collaborators. I am
    JasonJWilliamsNY on GitHub.

7/17/2017     Williams, Jason <williams@cshl.edu> (I replied 7/20)

    Forgot where I am going. Sure; we can chat by phone any time
    (office: 516-367-5186). I am used to conference calls at home when
    needed, so Google Hangouts can work when we need that.
